We recently embarked on a captivating journey to reclaim 42.67 BTC ( Approx. 1.8 Million US Dollar ) for a client ensnared in a complex situation. The challenge revolved around a disordered seed with 24 words, and 8 were missing. Leveraging a combination of brute force and sophisticated seed matching, our team decoded the puzzle, recovering the lost cryptocurrency.

## Assessment

The client’s dilemma featured a partially intact seed, with crucial words eroded on paper. Holding only a fragment of the seed intensified the challenge. Armed with a 24-letter seed, 8 characters suffered severe damage, with 3 words entirely obliterated, complicating the recovery process. Remarkably, one word provided a slight advantage, as its last letter remained visible, aiding our decryption efforts, while the other 2 remained elusive. Nonetheless, at Moon Syntax, we thrive on challenges, making this case no exception.

## Approach

### Partial Seed Recovery

The initial step involved a meticulous reconstruction of the partially eroded seed. Moon Syntax harnessed advanced cryptographic algorithms to decipher the obscured words. This delicate process demanded a deep understanding of cryptographic patterns and linguistic nuances, enabling the team to reconstruct a significant portion of the seed.

### Hybrid Solution-Balancing Strengths

Moon Syntax seamlessly integrated the brute force method into the recovery process with probabilistic seed matching which narrowed down possibilities intelligently, the brute force component cast a wider net, ensuring that no potential combination was overlooked. This hybrid solution optimized computational resources without compromising on thoroughness.

## Result

In a surprising twist, Moon Syntax not only recovered the damaged seed but also successfully brute-forced the missing words. The client’s cryptocurrency, totaling 42.67 BTC, was restored, showcasing our dedication to excellence in cryptocurrency recovery.

## Fees

While our standard fee is 20% (8.4 BTC), we recognised the case’s complexity and negotiated with the client. Initially agreeing on 8.4 BTC, we finalised the deal at 7 BTC, reflecting our commitment to fairness and client satisfaction. Given the substantial amount (over 1.8 million dollars), we mutually agreed that a 20% fee was too high, opting for a more reasonable arrangement. At Moon Syntax, we take client confidentiality seriously. With the client’s approval and a successful cryptocurrency recovery, we’re sharing this story to show our commitment to transparency.
